This is a click and shoot game inspired by my concept of "Home". <br/>
The board is divided into four seasons. <br/>
In spring, there are sunflowers, orchids, and you can play football with foxes.<br/>
In summer, there is rain, arcade games, and you can throw onions to collect retro game food items.<br/>
In fall, you can bike through maple trees and throw leaves at the goldening bushes.<br/>
In winter, you can throw snowballs at the snowmans.<br/>
The player would walk through the environment, and aim and shoot all the target items to win.<br/>
